Their support for USB opens up so many new AV workflows and we can’t wait to see how our customers will use them.” Commented Steven Liang, VP of Product Development at Lumens.<br><br>Another key feature of the new OIP-N pair is the ability to extend a USB webcam. Traditionally, webcams were limited by the maximum length of a USB cable. Now, OIP-N60D can receive a webcam input, transmitting the signal over IP networks for conversion back to USB by OIP-N40E.</p>",http://go.cin7.com/webfiles/LeadingSolutionsNZ/webpages/images/582162/LM-OIP-N40E.JPG,0,OIP-N40E,,1268.28,1014.62,0
PC193,20x Zoom Document Camera with VGA/HDMI Input and Output - Black,,,,Lumens,"<section><h4>Excellent Image Quality</h4>Lumens PC193 captures documents and 3D objects for live HD display on projectors and monitors. Featuring VGA and HDMI outputs, the visualizer supports resolutions up-to 1080 and produces sharp, vivid, and bright images. With a built-in power adapter and onboard recording, PC193 can be used as a standalone document camera, without the need for a host computer or network connection.</section><section><h4>Expandable Media Storage</h4>The PC193's internal image store can be expanded using a USB flash drive up-to a maximum 4TB. Files stored locally can be played out to screens, or shared with colleagues for playback on any computer or smart device. &nbsp;<h4>Standalone Creativity</h4>Most document cameras require a PC for annotation and live graphic overlay. By connecting a USB mouse to the unit, users have access to a range of drawing, highlighting and masking tools which will enhance any live presentation.&nbsp;</section><section><h4>Computer Integration</h4>Connect PC193 to a PC via USB to enjoy even greater creativity. Lumens Ladibug software for PC and Mac brings advanced annotation tools to desktop computers. Users can add text, spotlight and erase regions of an image, and much more. Connecting the camera to a computer by USB also turns PC193 into a webcam, recognized by all major video conferencing software, such as Teams, Zoom, and Webex. The high-quality camera and in-built microphone combine to deliver a truly versatile collaborative communication tool.<h4>Picture Perfect</h4>With an adjustable lamp and the camera mounted on a flexible gooseneck, users can capture the image they want, without distracting reflections or uneven lighting. Once the camera and light are perfectly positioned, the one-click Auto-Tune button quickly adjusts the clarity, brightness, and color to produce great-looking pictures without any user input.&nbsp;</section><ul><li>1080 output (30fps) &nbsp;</li><li>Flexible gooseneck design&nbsp;</li><li>VGA input/output, HDMI input/output&nbsp;</li><li>Built-in microphone&nbsp;</li><li>Internal recording with support for USB drive expansion&nbsp;</li><li>Innovative built-in power supply&nbsp;</li></ul>",http://go.cin7.com/webfiles/LeadingSolutionsNZ/webpages/images/582162/LM-PC-193.jpg,1,PC-193,,1300.91,1001.70,0
PS753,4K Desktop Document Camera with HDMI/VGA/USB and IP streaming,,,,Lumens,"<section><h4>Superior Image Quality</h4>With a 4K camera and powerful zoom, the PS753 delivers remarkably detailed images to screens and projectors.<br>The high-performance Sony sensor faithfully reproduces textures and colors in real-time, with excellent control over image noise.<h4>Wide Shooting Area</h4>Lumens PS753 is extremely versatile, capable of reproducing documents and objects larger than A3 in size (over 20.5"" x 12.1"" / 50cm x 30cm). This gives presenters and demonstrators the flexibility that less powerful visualizers cannot match. Where the operator needs a close-up shot, the 300x zoom can capture the finest detail. For maximum versatility, the ePTZ functionality changes the camera angle and position to focus on a specific part of the object. This gives you the precise image you need every time.</section><section><h4>Multi-Angle Lighting</h4>The Lumens PS753 has dual lights on adjustable gooseneck mounts: any object is perfectly lit from above without glare or reflections. It also has a backlit LED light under the display area, making the visualizer ready to illuminate photo negatives and X-rays from below.<h4>Easy to Use</h4>Despite its advanced features, Lumens PS753 is very easy to use. The Auto-Tune immediately calibrates the camera to deliver a perfectly focused image with accurate colors. The annotation tool allows the user to draw over the image on the screen without installing any additional software. It’s fast, convenient, and simple to use. Use the included <a href=""https://www.mylumens.com/en/Products_detail/1069/Ladibug-4K"" target=""_blank""><u>Ladibug software</u></a> for advanced image control and connect to remote guests using your favorite conferencing platforms, such as Zoom, Meet, Skype, Teams, or WebEx.</section><section><h4>Fast Installation</h4>The PS753 is very easy to install. Power is provided over your Ethernet network (PoE) without additional power supplies. The system can output live pictures over a connection that suits the way you work: it links directly to a display or projector over HDMI or VGA or streams images over your network.</section><ul><li>4K Resolution with 300x zoom</li><li>Supports HDMI, VGA, Ethernet, and USB output</li><li>Shooting area (20.5"" x 12.1"") larger than A3</li><li>Records to USB drives</li><li>HDMI pass-through up to 4K resolution</li></ul><section><br></section>",http://go.cin7.com/webfiles/LeadingSolutionsNZ/webpages/images/582162/LM-PS-752.jpg,0.1,PS-753,,2494.68,1920.90,0
