A-BT-US-B,Atlas IED,DSP,"The Atmosphere A-BT-B is a remote Bluetooth&trade; audio input (mono) to an Atmosphere AZM audio processor. This expansion allows the Bluetooth&trade; receiver to be optimally placed for wireless coverage. The AZM will automatically detect the A-BT and dynamically assign appropriate audio settings, such as makeup gain, EQ, and auto gain control, to that input. The stereo source audio is summed to a mono signal before being sent to the AZM.  Each Atmosphere accessory is a plug-and-play, intelligent device, specifically designed to be approachable and intuitive. The Atmosphere accessory bus allows for up to 8 devices to be connected to a single accessory port, reliably sending audio and data over 1000ft per port. Up to 1x audio input accessory can be added to each accessory port.",$412.09,$677.00

Powerful DSP combined with innovative algorithms offer custom solutions for a wide variety of spaces.  A built-in message player, virtual wall controllers, learning ambient noise sensing, Tilter Filter, auto-gain, GPIO, bell scheduler, room combine, and many more features, make the AZMP a processing powerhouse.  The AZMP8 utilizes amplifier power sharing technology that allows for efficient use of available power and avoiding system overdesign due to traditional amplifier power ratings. The AZMP8 can produce 1200W of total power, with each output channel being software assignable anywhere between 5-600W.  The AZMP8 is compatible with all six of the Atmosphere wall plate accessories for control, remote audio input, and ambient noise sensing. Up to 16 of these plug-and-play Accessories can be connected across 4 accessory ports on the AZMP8.  Additionally, a zone paging station can be added as an accessory.  Each port is designed to work reliably up to 1000ft.  Programming is simple through a modern on-board web interface, optimized around common use-cases.  Built around Progressive Web App technology, the control interface is device agnostic, responsive, and meticulously designed for an ideal user experience without sacrificing design freedom.  In addition to Ethernet, built-in Wi-Fi allows for tablets and other controlling devices to connect directly to the AZMP8.

Our patent-pending data collection technique pairs nicely with our patent-pending automatic ANC by learning from user adjustments at specific noise levels and enables the Atmosphere system to adapt a unique curve for each space. This learning algorithm results in environmental configurations that are worry-free.  The AZM can accept up to four X-ANS sensor per zone. And for those installations where privacy is of paramount importance, the X-ANS only sends sensor data back, not audio.
